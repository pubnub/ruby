### Upgrading from PubNub 3.6.x / 3.7.x

Main change is that we're no longer using EventMachine. Right now Celluloid is used. Public API remain unchanged.
If you encounter any issues while upgrading from EventMachine version, please contact us at support@pubnub.com you can also find eventmachine version in "eventmachine" branch of this repo.

### Upgrading from PubNub 3.5.x

We've made the response format compatible across all operations. This may break existing parsing of where_now, leave, state, and PAM responses. So if you are monitoring these operation responses, please be sure to modify your code accordingly.

Examples of affected operations can be found [here](3.5_to_3.6_upgrade_notes.md).

### Upgrading from PubNub 3.3.x and Earlier
PubNub 3.7.3 is NOT compatible with earlier than 3.4 versions of Pubnub Ruby Client.
